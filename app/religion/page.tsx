        <p>
          Religion is an important part of life for many of the peoples of
          Spira, with a large majority of the population describing themselves
          as &quot;Yevonites&quot;. Though by the end of Final Fantasy X some
          people had begun to question them, nevertheless the teachings of Yevon
          were millennium-old and heavily influential. The Yevonite clergy
          taught that Sin was a divine punishment set upon the people for their
          pride in the use of machines. As a result, the temples forbade the use
          of modern technology, and promoted a culture of atonement for past
          sins in the hopes of appeasing Sin. While the Yevon church forbids
          most machina including weapons, their capital Bevelle retains machina
          to ensure its dominance. The Al Bhed are seen as dangerous to the
          Yevon clergy because they use machina and pose a threat to the
          church&apos;s uncontested control of Spira. The church retains its
          power by role in using the Final Summoning which results in the
          sacrifice of the summoner and her guardian to prevent its secrets from
          being divulged. Though Yevon set up Operation Mi&apos;ihen to instill
          further loyalty to the teachings by making the Crusaders use machina
          that would never win against Sin.
